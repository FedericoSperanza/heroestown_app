# Welcome to HeroesTown App !

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The heroes had come to a gnome village and use this awesome application to get the data from the city, filter the gnome's data, view her profile picture and iterate over the pages.
-For Friends and Professions you can hover the text to see long text fields.
-You can Export the current view table to a csv file.
-Columns can be hidden and shown as needed, also the density from the grid can be changed as needed.

-The launch.json configs were uploaded if they are needed to run the app in non-security mode.
